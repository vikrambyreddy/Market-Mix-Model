What is a Marketing Mix Model?

A Marketing Mix Model is a modeling technique used to determine market attribution, the estimated impact of each marketing channel that a given company is using.

Unlike Attribution Modeling, another technique used for marketing attribution, Marketing Mix Models attempt to measure the impact of immeasurable marketing channels, like TV, radio, and newspapers.

Generally, your output variable will be sales or conversions, but can also be things like website traffic. Your input variables typically consist of marketing spend by channel by period (day, week, month, quarter, etc…), but can also include other variables which we’ll get to later.

Why is it so Useful?

You can tap into the power of a marketing mix model in a number of ways, including:

To get a better understanding of the relationships between your marketing channels and your target metric (i.e. conversions).

To distinguish high ROI marketing channels from low ones and ultimately better optimize your marketing budget.

To predict future conversions based on given inputs.
